# Human-Activity-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning
The growth of deep learning as a discipline facilitates the development of intelligent devices and software that can aid humans in their daily activities. A prominent instance of deep learning in action is Human Activity Recognition (HAR). A subset of machine learning known as deep learning is effectively applied to the identification of human activities. To detect human activities in this project, we implemented a model that utilized Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) and Long Short-Term Memory with Convolutional Networks (LRCN). The UCF50 dataset was utilized to train this model, enabling it to undergo exhaustive testing and validation. An additional dataset is generated by dividing the primary dataset (UCF 50) into two sections: validation and testing, each consistingÂ of ten action categories. When applied to the following dataset, the accuracy of the ConvLSTM model is 81.4%, while the accuracy of the LRCN model is 85.3%.
